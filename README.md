# Titanic-EDA-Python
Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic dataset using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
# Titanic EDA Project 🚢

## 📖 Overview
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the classic Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The main goal was to identify key factors that influenced passenger survival during the tragedy.

## 📚 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## 🛠️ Key Steps:
- Data Cleaning:
  - Handled missing values for `Age`, `Embarked`, and `Cabin`
  - Filled `Age` with median, `Embarked` with mode, and `Cabin` with 'Unknown'
- Descriptive Statistics & Correlation Analysis
- GroupBy Analysis:
  - Survival rate by Gender, Pclass, Fare
- Visualizations:
  - Countplots, Histograms, Heatmaps
- Published final notebook on Kaggle

## 📊 Insights:
- Female survival rate was significantly higher than males
- 1st class passengers had better survival chances
- Fare had a mild positive impact on survival probability
